# University-Projects
University group projects from 1st and 2nd Year. Covering both practical and theoritical projects. Each completed over 1 semester.
A technical report describing the project in detail was required and individual interviews were carried out where we were questioned on our work.
A group presentation and a process report were also part of our assessment.
Each project aims to solve a given problem statement and is in line with a related SDG (Sustainable Development Goal).
The different roles I had throughout the projects include Scribe, Builder, Researcher, Tester and Programmer. This range of roles allowed me to be invloved of every aspect of a project including planning & management, analysis & design and implementation.
From these project I now have experience in the following areas:
- MATLAB / Simulink
- MakeBlock Kit (Robotics Kits)
- Scratch (MBlock Coding Platform)
- Project Planning
- Project Management
- Group Presentations
- Technical & Process Report Writing
