# University-Projects
University group projects from 1st Year to 3rd Year. Including both hardware and software projects.
Each project aims to solve a given problem statemnt and is in line with a related SDG (Sustainable Development Goal).
The different roles I had throughout the projects include Scribe, Builder, Researcher, Tester and Programmer. This range of roles allowed me to be invloved of every aspect of a project including planning, design and implementation.
